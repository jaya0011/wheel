ðŸŽ¡ Ferris Wheel Project â€“ Report

This project is an animated Ferris wheel built using HTML and CSS. The wheel structure is created with a circular .wheel container, six spokes (.line), and six passenger cabins (.cabin).
The wheel rotates continuously using CSS keyframes, while the cabins counter-rotate to remain upright. Cabins also change colors (red â†’ yellow â†’ purple), adding a dynamic effect.

Key Features:
Pure HTML & CSS, no JavaScript.
Smooth infinite rotation.
Upright cabins with color-changing animation.
Responsive design using vw units.

Learning Outcomes:
Use of CSS animations, transform-origin, and nested animations.
Creative visual design with only front-end technologies.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the power of CSS animations by creating an engaging Ferris wheel effect without JavaScript.
